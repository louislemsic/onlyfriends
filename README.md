# OnlyFriends
A chat application utilizing the features of Firebase's Authentication, Real-time Database, and Notifications. My co-workers for this project are Aki Escarraga and Cyrl de Guzman. This project is created for submission as a partial completion of the course Mobile Development at De La Salle University and is meant for educational purposes only. The app is meant to be a replica of OnlyFans and uses similar colors and logo to create a parody of it.

## Running the files in Android Studio
1. Either download the files through ZIP or Clone this using cmd by typing:<br />`git clone git@github.com:louislemsic/onlyfriends.git`
2. Make sure the file `local.properties` is present and automatically made by Android Studio.
3. If `local.properties` is missing, rebuild the app inside Android Studio.
4. Press the Run Button inside the app. 

### Reminders
* The app requires at least version Lollipop.
* Any questions and suggestions, please feel free to contact me at louislemsic@gmail.com.
